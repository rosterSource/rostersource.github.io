# Provider Roster PaaS

Community developers manage the free software and an open business model helps health system staff, health insurance staff, and other industry participants manage their own or their partners’ federated data. All the difficult security-related, compliance-focused, and data quality capabilities are baked into the open source solution. You point us to your provider data in EHRs, practice management, or RCM systems and we take care of the back end infrastructure and data exhange.

The quality of physician demographics and which insurance plans they accept remains a challenge across the healthcare ecosystem. Even answering a simple question like “is a particular provider accepting new patients?” is not easy to answer.

No single stakeholder or institution can solve this problem alone. The RosterNet community was created to pull all participants into a single open source community so that resources--senior infrastructure and system architects with the skills needed to manage secure provider roster data--can be shared across institutions.
