      <description>Physician Roster ChallengeHealthcare Provider roster changes are difficult to capture and harder to share by a physician practice. Roster updates are done on EHR/EMR, RCM, HR system or maintained in a spreadsheet, but are not integrated with a physician practice website or with supported Health Insurance Plans. This lack of automation adds cost, reduces productivity and can lead to revenue loss or an unsatisfactory patient experience. Healthcare Insurance Plans are on the hook for CMS penalties, forcing manual cross checks for regular physician roster updates.</description>
